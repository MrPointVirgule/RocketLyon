Live demo : https://p-l.ninja/RocketLyon

## What works
  - Web app
   - [X] Display TCL's data
   - [X] Search nearest stations
   - [X] See stops in street view
  
  - Android
   - [X] Display TCL's data
   - [X] Search nearest stations
## Installation

Just install it on you web server, either apache, nginx..

Generate the .json data, for TCL, download the .sqlite from http://app.tcl.fr/flux/mobile_referential/android/3/referential_android.zip and launch genData.php.

## Motivation

The current google play TCL ("Transports en Communs Lyonnais") app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.micropole.android.tcl_mobile is old and do not respect google's guidelines anymore.. Moreover, there is no app for windows 10, and the windows phone app is really basic..
